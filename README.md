# Serverless Framework Node HTTP API on AWS

### Deployment

```
$ serverless deploy
```

After deploying, you should see output similar to:

```bash
Deploying aws-node-http-api-project to stage dev (us-east-1)

âœ” Service deployed to stack aws-node-http-api-project-dev (152s)

endpoint: GET - https://xxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
functions:
  hello: aws-node-http-api-project-dev-hello (1.9 kB)
```

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can call the created application via HTTP:

```bash
curl https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
```

Which should result in response similar to the following (removed `input` content for brevity):

```json
{
  "message": "Go Serverless v2.0! Your function executed successfully!",
  "input": {
    ...
  }
}
```

### Local development

You can invoke your function locally by using the following command:
It is also possible to emulate API Gateway and Lambda locally by using `serverless-offline` plugin. In order to do that, execute the following command:

```bash
npm run dev

post to http://localhost:3000/dev/transactions

```
Input String
```angular2html
[{
"transactionId": "1234",
"orderId": "12345",
"merchantId": "User1",
"merchantType": "food",
"value": 123
},
{
"transactionId": "1234",
"orderId": "12345",
"merchantId": "User1",
"merchantType": "food",
"value": 123
},  {
"transactionId": "1234",
"orderId": "12345",
"merchantId": "User2",
"merchantType": "food",
"value": 123
}]
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```
{
    "data": [
        {
            "merchantId": "User1",
            "gross": 246,
            "net": 246,
            "average": 123
        },
        {
            "merchantId": "User2",
            "gross": 123,
            "net": 123,
            "average": 123
        }
    ],
    "message": "",
    "status": "success"
}
```

```
serverless offline
```

## Testing

Tests are located in the `tests` folder an can be invoked by running `yarn unit-test` and `yarn feature-test`. These
tests will invoke the defined  actions in a wrapper, where the response can then be tested.
